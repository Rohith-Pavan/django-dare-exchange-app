# Dare Exchange - Django Project Setup Guide

A Django web application for creating, accepting, and completing dares with user authentication and rating system.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, make sure you have the following installed on your PC:

### 1. Python Installation
- **Download Python 3.8 or higher** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, **make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"**
- Verify installation by opening Command Prompt/Terminal and running:
  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

### 2. Git (Optional but Recommended)
- Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- This will help you clone and manage the project

## Project Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get the Project Files

**Option A: If you have the project folder**
- Copy the entire Django project folder to your desired location
- Open Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to the project folder:
  ```bash
  cd path/to/your/Django/project
  ```

**Option B: If using Git**
- Clone the repository (if available):
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  cd Django
  ```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Note:** You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt when activated.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Database Setup

Set up the database and create necessary tables:

```bash
# Apply database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser account (admin)
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

When creating the superuser:
- Enter a username (e.g., admin)
- Enter your email address
- Create a strong password
- Remember these credentials for admin access

### Step 5: Load Sample Data (Optional)

If there are management commands to populate sample data:

```bash
# Check available management commands
python manage.py help

# If populate_dares command exists:
python manage.py populate_dares
```

### Step 6: Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output like:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"python is not recognized"**
   - Make sure Python is added to your system PATH
   - Try using `py` instead of `python`

2. **"No module named django"**
   - Make sure your virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

3. **Database errors**
   - Delete `db.sqlite3` file and run `python manage.py migrate` again
   - Make sure you're in the correct project directory

4. **Port already in use**
   - Use a different port: `python manage.py runserver 8001`
   - Or stop any other Django servers running

### Getting Help:

- Check Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/
- Make sure all commands are run from the project root directory
- Ensure virtual environment is activated before running commands

## Development Notes

- The project uses SQLite database (no additional database setup required)
- Debug mode is enabled (suitable for development only)

- The project includes custom management commands for data management

## Next Steps

After successful setup:
