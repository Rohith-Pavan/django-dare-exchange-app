- [ ] `DEBUG` = `False`

## üöÄ Final Steps
- [ ] Web app reloaded
- [ ] Site accessible at `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`
- [ ] Admin panel accessible at `yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/admin/`
- [ ] Static files loading correctly (CSS/images)
- [ ] Sample dares visible on homepage

## üß™ Testing
- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] Dare creation works
- [ ] Image uploads work (if using)
- [ ] All navigation links work

## üîß Troubleshooting
If something isn't working:

1. **Check the Error Log:**
   - Go to Web tab ‚Üí Error log
   - Look for recent errors

2. **Common Issues:**
   - **Import errors:** Check virtual environment is activated
   - **Static files not loading:** Verify static files mapping
   - **Database errors:** Ensure migrations were run
   - **500 errors:** Check environment variables are set correctly

3. **Test Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Test settings
   python manage.py check --settings=dareproject.pythonanywhere_settings
   
   # Test database connection
